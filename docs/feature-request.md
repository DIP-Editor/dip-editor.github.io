<h1 align="center">Request a Feature</h1>

## How do I request a feature?

To request a feature, simply create an issue with the named "Feature Request: {feature idea}". In the issue, describe the feature you would like to see implemented. If you have any ideas on how to implement it, feel free to include that as well. Features are not guaranteed to be implemented, but they will be considered. To improve chances of a feature being implemented, it is recommended to create a pull request with the feature implemented. This will allow for the feature to be tested and reviewed before being implemented into the main branch.

## What are examples of features that could be requested?

Some examples of features that were requested in the past (and either are in the works, planned, or completed) include:

 - A hidden character highlighter,
