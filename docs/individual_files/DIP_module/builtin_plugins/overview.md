<h1 align="center">Builtin Plugins Overview</h1>

> This page provides an overview of the builtin plugins.

In `DIP`, there are two ways for builtin functionality:

 1. The `DIP_module` module
 2. Builtin plugins

For methods that are essential to the functionality of `DIP`, they are put in the `DIP_module` module. For methods that are not essential to the functionality of `DIP` or don't quite fit in with the rest of the core, they are put in builtin plugins. This allows users to disable builtin plugins if they want to. This page will, therefore, provide an overview of the builtin plugins.

## Plugins
