## How do I contribute?

Just open an issue or pull request on the [DIP repository](https://www.github.com/DIP-Editor/DIP-dev) and we will be sure to look at it.

## What style should I follow when writing code for DIP?

The following poem is a good example of the style that is utilized in DIP:
### The Way of Pythonistas

To write Python code,\
Certain traits it must contain,\
Indeed: for ones code to load,\

Systems mustn’t need complain.
Short and verbose,\
First traits of good code,\
All details disclosed,\
In those files: it’s abode.

Flat and efficient,\
No nested for’s or if’s,\
One loop is sufficient,\
For it is not hieroglyphs.

No redundant code in sight,\
Keeping it fast and easy to read,\
Excessive code is a blight,\
Or intentions one may misread.

Standard formats well followed,\
A consistent sight for sore eyes,\
Programs and file be hollowed,\
Having no fear of some surprise.

Friendly and documented,\
No slang used in README’s,\
All API usage cemented,\
Common rules: heed these.

Variables and functions self-explanatory,\
Recognizable: needing few comments,\
And though rules are not mandatory,\
It helps one understand the contents.

Self dependent with few imports,\
Builtins and self-made are best,\
Reliable: providing out few retorts,\
Bugs and issues: already addressed.

Classes and modularity,\
OOP is always key,\
To bring to pass prosperity,\
In that future we may see.

Reusable and expandable,\
Code being portable and helpful,\
Why it must be understandable,\
Making one’s code forever useful.

This is the way of the Pythonista,\
It’s a humble yet invigorating creed,\
Your code not being a blister,\
Helping someone out there in need.
