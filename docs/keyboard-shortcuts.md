<h1 align="center">Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>

## What are keyboard shortcuts?

Simply put, keyboard shortcuts are binds that allow for quick access to certain actions. For example, the keyboard shortcut for copy is `Ctrl + C`. This allows for the user to quickly copy text without having to use the mouse to click the copy button. `DIP` has many keyboard shortcuts that allow for quick access to certain actions. 

## What keyboard shortcuts are implemented in `DIP`?

The following table shows all of the keyboard shortcuts that are currently implemented in `DIP`.
